I had a hard time understanding how cookies worked prior to starting this assignmnet. 

I looked at where cookies were stored in DevTools to get a better idea of what was going on. I looked at the Window.localstorage, object.values(), and Document.cookie documentation on Mozilla. I used console.log to see if certain aspects of my code were working. 

I also didn't notice the thumbs up animation for a while and was struggling to figure out why it didn't work before I realized that it was working.

I've been working with a tutor on better understanding JavaScript principals overall and feel that this has helped me understand how to complete assignments.
